Purpose: Describe where implementation notes live and how to name them.

# Implementation Notes

Use this folder for documentation about what the app currently does and how it is implemented. These are not project-phase plans, and they are not reusable context briefs or workflows; they capture the concrete shape of the current build.

## Examples
- `encryption-and-decryption-implementation.md`
- `nostr-queries-implementation.md`

## Conventions
- Keep each doc focused on a single implementation area.
- Prefer short, linkable files over long multi-topic documents.
- Start each file with a one-line purpose statement.
## Template
- Start new docs from `implementation-note-template.md`.
