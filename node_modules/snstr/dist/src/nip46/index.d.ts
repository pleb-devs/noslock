/**
 * NIP-46 Remote Signing Protocol
 *
 * This implementation provides a way to manage private keys remotely
 * and sign events from different clients. The protocol establishes a secure
 * connection between clients and a "bunker" which holds the private keys.
 *
 * Reference: https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/46.md
 *
 * Two implementations are provided:
 *
 * 1. NostrRemoteSignerClient/NostrRemoteSignerBunker:
 *    - Full-featured implementation with all NIP-46 capabilities
 *    - Supports auth challenges via URL
 *    - Handles permissions for specific event kinds
 *    - Supports both NIP-04 and NIP-44 encryption
 *    - Connection metadata for better UX
 *    - Secret token support for secure connections
 *
 * 2. SimpleNIP46Client/SimpleNIP46Bunker:
 *    - Simplified implementation for basic use cases
 *    - Minimal code with core functionality
 *    - NIP-04 encryption only
 *    - Basic permission handling
 *    - No auth challenges or metadata support
 *    - Good for learning and simple applications
 *
 * Choose the implementation that best fits your needs based on the complexity
 * and security requirements of your application.
